The goal of this project was to gain an understanding of crawling and parsing, while also working with search engines and measures to evaluate their responses, such as the cosine similarity and the tfIdf score. We were asked to create our own dataset by scraping the goodreads website and then create a search engine that would suggest books based on the user's query. We then focused on some book series, to analyze the total number of pages throughout their single books. Finally, we had to face some theory questions regarding recursive and dynamic programming.

The repository consists of the following files, other than this readme.md file:

1. __`main.ipynb`__: 
	> The Jupyter notebook that contains the answers to the main questions. In order to make the reading of this notebook more linear, most of the actual coding is found in the next file.
2. __`functions.py`__:
    > A Python script that contains the functions that were used in the `main.ipynb`.

**NB**: the data that we used are obscured by .gitignore file
